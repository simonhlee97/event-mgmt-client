## Focus of this repo:

- A component/file-folder structure that provides clean, easily scalable, and re-usable components
- use DummyData for EventsList
- css modules (to avoid className collisions)
- added 'react-icons'
- avoided Webpack (used Vite)

## Next Todos:

- [ ] Hide the SideNav in smaller, mobile viewports)
- [ ] Single Event view (/events/:id)
- [ ] CRUD Components and Forms
- integrate with Beege's repo? (connect to backend, database)
