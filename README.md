## Focus of this repo:

- A component/file-folder structure that provides clean, easily scalable, and re-usable components
- use DummyData for EventsList
- css modules (to avoid className collisions)
- added 'react-icons'
- avoided Webpack (used Vite)

## Next Todos:

- hide the SideNav in smaller, mobile viewports
- single Event view
- integrate with backend (connect to Database) and Beege's repo
